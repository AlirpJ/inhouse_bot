# Use case and behaviour

This bot is made to be used by trustworthy players queuing regularly for one or two roles.

There is one queue per discord channel the bot is in, but player ratings are common to all channels.

Players can queue in multiple channels and multiple roles. A game starting will drop them from 
all queues in all channels. A player canâ€™t re-enter a queue as long as any game theyâ€™re in has not been scored or 
cancelled.

Each playerâ€™s role rating is treated as an independent entity, and they all start from the same rating.
The rating system is based on [Microsoft TrueSkill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill).

# Queue features
`!queue role` puts you in the current channelâ€™s queue for the given role.

`!leave` removes you from the channelâ€™s queue for all roles.

`!leave all` removes you from all channelâ€™s queue for all roles.

`!won` scores your last game as a win for your team and waits for validation from at least 6 players from the game.

`!lost` is the counterpart to `!won`.

`!champion champion_name [game_id]` informs which champion you used for winrate tracking.
If you donâ€™t supply the `game_id`, it will apply to your last game.

`!view_queue` shows the queue in the current channel.

`!view_games` shows the ongoing games for all channels.

`!cancel_game` cancels your ongoing game, requiring validation from at least 6 players in the game.

`!admin_score game_id winner` is an admin-only command that scores the game without asking for validation.

# Stats features
`!history` returns your match history.

`!rank` returns your server-wide rank.

`!ranking role` returns the top 20 players in the given role.

`!mmr` returns your current MMR.

`!mmr_history` displays a graph of your MMR per role in the past month.

`!champions_stats` returns statistics about the champions you played.

# Wanted contributions (2020-05-11)
- `dpytest` does not support reactions to messages, which means the test functions are currently failing.
Any help with mocking those would be greatly welcomed.

- The current data flow needs to be slightly reviewed. The easy way is likely to simply store all ongoing games in memory
before committing them.

- The matchmaking algorithm is currently fully brute-force and can definitely be improved in terms of calculation time.

- Additions to stats visualisations are always welcomed!
